Overveiw of the project
In the modern business landscape, understanding customer behavior and preferences is critical for maintaining a competitive edge. 
Marketing strategies that treat all customers the same often result in wasted resources and reduced customer satisfaction. 
This project focuses on developing an AI/ML model to segment customers based on both behavioral and demographic data, 
enabling businesses to tailor their marketing campaigns to distinct groups and achieve higher conversion rates.

Dataset details
The primary dataset for this project is the 'Online Retail Dataset', which contains real-world transactional data from an online store. This dataset is widely used in data analytics and marketing research.
